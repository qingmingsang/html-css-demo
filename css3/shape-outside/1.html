            Starry, starry night paint your palette blue and gray look out on a summer's day with eyes that know the darkness in my soul.
            Shadows on the hills sketch the trees and the daffodils catch the breeze and the winter chills in colors on the
            snowy linen land. And now I understand what you tried to say to me and how you suffered for your sanity and how
            you tried to set them free. They would not listen they did not know how perhaps they'll listen now.
